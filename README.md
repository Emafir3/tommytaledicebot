# Tommytale Dice Discord Bot!
This is a discord bot made for the Tommytale campagin but maybe useful to others! With this bot you will be able to generate custom dice rolls directly in the discord server you are playing on! Maybe doing an online D&D campaign! (Like us right now)

# Installation
Simply clone the repo wherever you like and create an app ad a bot on the discord developer panel! (I'll be more specific later)

# How to use
When you added the bot your discord server simply type !d<number of the dice you want to roll> and you'll have a nice image with the die! There is however an exception, the d100 or percentual dice, that is represented by % so, !d% for it!
 
 # Example usage:
 !d10
 (prentending to be an img for now): 9
